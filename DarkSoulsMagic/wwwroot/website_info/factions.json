Once they took their share of the Flame's soul, they banded together to destroy the dragons who had dominated the world to that point. With the exception of the Furtive Pygmy, who shattered his soul to create humanity, the Lords used their souls to engineer vast kingdoms which they reigned over for thousands of years. The Lordran of today is formed from the decayed remnants of those kingdoms.",
